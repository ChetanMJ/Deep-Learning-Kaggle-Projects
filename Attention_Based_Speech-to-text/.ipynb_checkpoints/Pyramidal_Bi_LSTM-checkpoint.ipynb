    "2. In method `train` look for the updated mask logic, current logic makes all the instances 1.\n",
    "3. Check for the expected shape of the variable `text_input` in `train`. Though this is not a hard bound, but if you are getting a transpose shape than you need to change some other logic too. Hence we recommend you make sure the size of `text_input` is the same as mentioned."
